This program is based on Application 2: JXMapViewer.

Application 2 original sample code provided by Josh Marinacci:
http://today.java.net/pub/a/today/2007/10/30/building-maps-into-swing-app-with-jxmapviewer.html

JDK compiler version: 1.7
JVM/JRE version: JRE7

Although the JXMapViewer application was originally created in NetBeans, this derived application was developed in Eclipse.
All libraries have been imported into the /lib directory, here is a list of what is used:
swingx-ws-2007_10_14.jar
swing-worker.jar
swingx-bean.jar
swingx.jar
commons-codec-1.3.jar
commons-httpclient-3.0.1.jar
commons-logging-1.1.jar
jdom.jar
json.jar
jtidy-r7.jar
rome-0.8.jar
xercesImpl.jar

Please note that class files are contained within jac444a-5/build/classes, use the Navigator view to see
them in Eclipse.

Running the application in Eclipse:
1. Create or use an existing Java project, preferably one that is set to use JDK 1.7 and JRE7.
2. Right click the Java Project in the Project Explorer tab. Select Import.
3. Under General -> Archive File, Import the JAR file a2_mdafidchao.jar.
   Select Yes to All if asked to overwrite any files.
4. Expand /src. Right-click on the Mapapp package. Select Run As -> Java Application.

After creating the JAR file, I've imported the JAR file into Eclipse again. I've checked that there's no compilation error.
I will lose 50% if that's not the case.
